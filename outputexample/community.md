## Where to talk

anything and everything related to Rust. Ask questions here,

### Internals forum

The Rust Internals Forum is a place for discussion about the
development of Rust itself &ndash; including work on the compiler
as well as the design of the language and the standard library.

## Where to learn

## Read about Rust

The Rust programming language has many qualities, but Rust’s greatest
strength is the community of people who come together to make working in
Rust a rewarding experience.

Stay up to date with the Rust community!

## Events

### Find a local meetup or conference

There are more than 90 Meetups and several conferences worldwide in over 35 countries. Rustaceans meet periodically in Rust User Groups. They are a great introduction to the community and a great way to learn and socialize with other people with a similar interest. Meetings are usually informal and open to everyone.

### Run your own event

As Rust grows, we’re excited to help folks start their own local events.
From hack and learns, to meetups, to conferences, the Rust Events Team is
ready to help support you.

Registering your event helps us to keep track of our community efforts and
allows us to connect you to speakers or other members in your area.
