# Governance

## How Rust is built by its community

## RFC process

Each major decision in Rust starts as a Request for Comments (RFC).
Everyone is invited to discuss the proposal, to work toward a shared understanding of the tradeoffs.
Though sometimes arduous, this community deliberation is Rust’s secret sauce for quality.
